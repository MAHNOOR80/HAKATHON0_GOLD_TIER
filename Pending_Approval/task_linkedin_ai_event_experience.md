# LinkedIn Post: My Experience at the AI Event

## Draft Content

Just attended an AI event — and it completely shifted my perspective.

The conversations happening right now in the AI space are not just about technology. They are about how businesses, teams, and entire industries are rethinking the way they work.

Here are 3 things that stood out to me:

1. The gap between AI hype and real-world implementation is closing fast. Companies are no longer asking "should we use AI?" — they are asking "how do we scale it?"

2. The most impressive projects were not built by the biggest teams. They were built by small, focused groups who understood their problem deeply before reaching for a tool.

3. Community matters more than ever. The people building the future of AI are not working in isolation — they are sharing, collaborating, and learning from each other in real time.

Walking out of that event, one thing was clear: the best time to get involved in AI is right now. Not next quarter. Not next year. Now.

If you are exploring how AI can fit into your business or workflow, I am happy to share what I learned. DMs are always open.
