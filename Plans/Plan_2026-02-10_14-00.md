# Task Execution Plan — 2026-02-10

## Summary

- **Total Pending Tasks**: 3
- **High Priority**: 0
- **Medium Priority**: 3
- **Awaiting Approval**: 0 (2 will be gated by Approval_Check_Skill during execution)
- **Ready to Execute**: 1 (newsletter archive — no MCP action)

### Tasks by Type
| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| email_response (reply needed) | 2 |
| email_response (archive only) | 1 |

## Suggested Execution Order

### Batch 1: Immediate — No Approval Needed
1. [ ] **Weekly Industry Digest - AI Trends** — `task_email_Weekly Industry Digest - AI Trends.md` — Newsletter, no reply. Read and archive to /Done/.

### Batch 2: Needs Approval (send_email gated)
1. [ ] **Project Proposal Review Request** — `task_email_Project Proposal Review Request_1.md` — Draft reply to client@example.com with acknowledgment. Route through Approval_Check_Skill.
2. [ ] **Partnership Opportunity - AI Consulting** — `task_email_Partnership Opportunity - AI Consulting_1.md` — Draft reply to team@startup.io to schedule call. Route through Approval_Check_Skill.

## Risks and Unclear Items

- [ ] **Project Proposal Review**: No actual attachment to review — reply will acknowledge receipt and request the attachment or clarify next steps.
- [ ] **Partnership Opportunity**: No calendar availability — reply will express interest and ask for preferred times.

## Strategy

Process the newsletter archive first (Batch 1) since it requires no approval and clears the queue. Then draft professional replies for both client emails and route them through the Approval_Check_Skill gate to /Pending_Approval/. Human reviews and approves/rejects each draft before any email is sent. This plan processes all 3 tasks in a single Ralph loop session.
