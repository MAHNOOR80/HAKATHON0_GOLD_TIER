## 4. Recommendations

1. **URGENT: Investigate the $6,500 transfer to Unknown LLC.** This is the single largest expense and flagged as suspicious. Verify the vendor, check for authorization, and escalate if unauthorized.

2. **Approve or reject the 2 pending email replies today.** John Smith has been waiting 4 days for proposal feedback (his deadline is Friday). Sarah Chen's Q2 partnership inquiry is time-sensitive. Both drafts are ready in `/Pending_Approval/`.

3. **Respond to client_john's pricing inquiry within 24 hours.** This is a hot lead — direct pricing ask for a 5-person team. Draft a consulting package and approve the send.

4. **Post content mid-week (Tue/Thu).** Social engagement peaked on weekends but weekday professional audience is larger. Repurpose the top-performing AI consulting post as a LinkedIn article.

5. **Review and clear bank anomalies.** 10 flagged transactions across 2 CSV files. Most are legitimate (expected revenue), but the Unknown LLC transfer and large vendor payment need verification.
