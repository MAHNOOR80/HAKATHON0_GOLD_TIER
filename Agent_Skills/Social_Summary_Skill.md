# Social Summary Skill

## Description

This skill generates a daily social media engagement report by analysing
LinkedIn and X (Twitter) activity. It identifies **revenue leads** hidden
in comments, tracks engagement trends, and produces an actionable summary
in `/Plans/Social_Summary_<date>.md`.

This is a **read-only, reporting skill** — it does not post or reply.
Use `LinkedIn_Post_Skill` and `Approval_Check_Skill` for outbound actions.

## Position in Reasoning Loop

```
[Scheduler triggers daily]
    --> social_watcher.py fetches engagement data (API or demo)
    --> Social_Summary_Skill analyses the data
    --> Generates /Plans/Social_Summary_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
    --> Updates Dashboard.md "Social Summaries" section
    --> Logs to System_Log.md
    --> If revenue leads found: creates task in /Needs_Action/
```

---

## Inputs

- LinkedIn API data (via `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`) **or** demo engagement data

- Date range: last 7 days by default (configurable)

## Outputs

| # | Platform | Person | Signal | Comment Excerpt | Action |
|---|----------|--------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | LinkedIn | Sarah Chen | "partnership" | "Would love to discuss a partnership..." | Follow up |
| 2 | LinkedIn | Mike R. | "consulting" | "Do you offer consulting for startups?" | Reply with offer |
| 3 | X | @devteam | "hire" | "Looking to hire an AI consultant..." | DM |

### Lead Score
- **Hot leads (reply within 24h):** 2
- **Warm leads (reply within 72h):** 1
- **Informational (no action):** 19

## Engagement Trends (7-day)

- Impressions: ▲ 12% vs previous week
- Engagement rate: ▲ 0.3pp vs previous week
- Best posting time: Tuesday 10:00 AM, Thursday 2:00 PM

## Recommendations

1. Reply to Sarah Chen re: partnership opportunity (Hot lead)
2. Reply to Mike R. re: consulting inquiry (Hot lead)
3. Post again Thursday — engagement peaks mid-week
4. Repurpose top post as a LinkedIn article for longer reach

## Revenue Lead Detection

The skill scans all comments, replies, and DMs for **buying signals**:

### Signal Keywords (case-insensitive)

| Category | Keywords |
|----------|----------|
| Direct intent | consulting, hire, budget, pricing, proposal, quote, rates |
| Partnership | partnership, collaborate, joint venture, co-founder |
| Availability | available, schedule, call, meeting, demo, book |
| Services | services, offering, portfolio, capabilities, expertise |
| Urgency | ASAP, urgent, this week, deadline, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 |

### Lead Scoring

| Score | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Hot** (reply < 24h) | 2+ signal keywords, or direct ask (e.g., "Do you offer...?") | Create task in `/Needs_Action/` with `approval_needed: true` |
| **Warm** (reply < 72h) | 1 signal keyword, conversational tone | Note in summary, no task |
| **Informational** | No signal keywords, general engagement | Count only |

## Data Sources

### LinkedIn (live mode)
- Endpoint: `GET /v2/ugcPosts?q=authors&authors=List({personUrn})`
- Endpoint: `GET /v2/socialActions/{postUrn}/comments`
- Requires: `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `LINKEDIN_PERSON_URN`

### X / Twitter (live mode)
- Endpoint: `GET /2/users/{id}/tweets` (with `tweet.fields=public_metrics`)
- Requires: `X_BEARER_TOKEN`

### Demo mode
- Generates realistic sample data (8 posts, 22 comments, 3 leads)
- No credentials needed — perfect for hackathon demo

## Notes

- This is a **read-only skill** — never posts, replies, or DMs without
  explicit user instruction routed through Approval_Check_Skill
- Revenue lead detection is keyword-based; false positives are possible —
  always review before acting
- Summary files accumulate in `/Plans/` — use `log_manager.py` pattern
  to archive old summaries if needed
- Combine with Odoo `get_report` to correlate social leads with invoiced revenue
